What is Plasma?

Plasma is a framework for creating and managing decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a second-layer scaling solution that aims to 
solve the problem of high transaction costs and slow processing times on the Ethereum network by allowing for the creation of "child chains" that run on top of the
Ethereum 
blockchain.

Plasma child chains can process transactions and execute smart contracts independently, but still rely on the security of the Ethereum blockchain for settlement.
This allows for increased scalability, as the child chains can handle a much higher volume of transactions than the main Ethereum blockchain. Each child chain is 
responsible for its own security and can be tailored to the specific needs of the application.

The Plasma framework is based on a series of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts are responsible for creating and
managing the child chains, as well as handling the flow of assets between the child chains and the Ethereum blockchain.

One of the key features of Plasma is the use of "commitment transactions", which are used to record the state of the child chain on the Ethereum blockchain. These 
commitment transactions are periodically committed to the Ethereum blockchain and serve as a way of ensuring that the state of the child chain is in sync with the 
Ethereum blockchain.

Plasma also includes a mechanism called "plasma exits" which allows users to move their assets back to the main Ethereum blockchain if they wish to do so. This is
achieved by "proving" the existence of the assets on the child chain, and then submitting that proof to the Ethereum blockchain. These exits can be done in two ways,
the first one is called "Standard Exit" which is a process in which any user can initiate the process of exiting their assets from the child chain. The second one is
called "Exit Game" in which any user can challenge the exit process by providing a proof of fraud, if the challenge is proven the exit process will be stopped.

In conclusion, Plasma is a framework that allows for the creation of highly-scalable decentralized applications by utilizing child chains that can handle a high volume
of transactions while still maintaining the security and trustlessness of the Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts, commitment transactions, and plasma 
exits.
