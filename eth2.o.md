The merge is the Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).

PoS: Blockchain consensus comes from people (stakers) who lock up their Ethereum.

PoW: Consensus for the blockchain comes from people (miners) who secure the network with computing power.

Why? 

Ethereum has a lot of problems, and has worked towards solving the blockchain trilemma:

• Security
• Decentralization
• Scalability 

Blockchains so far have had to compromise on at least one of these characteristics.

While it doesn't make Ethereum perfect, it helps.

How does the Merge help?

• Decentralization/Security: The Merge requires a minimum amount of nodes & makes it easier to run a node 

• Sustainability: PoS uses roughly 99% less energy than PoW

• Scalability: Opens the door for sharding, which may someday allow for 100k TPS
To run a node you need to stake 32 ETH, and you have to lock up ETH until the Merge.

After the Merge, rewards will not go to miners, and go to stakers instead.

But this staking system brings about some problems, which brings us to:
2. Stake ETH

But since staking:

1. Requires 32 ETH
2. Requires you to lock up ETH

Providers have emerged that charge a fee to solve those problems.

These protocols are pretty simple:

• You deposit ETH
• The protocol stakes the ETH to a validator for you
• You receive a liquid (sellable) wrapper representing a right to that staked ETH
• The staked ETH accrues interest
• You can use the liquid wrapper on DeFi
RocketPool, Lido, StaFi, and more all let you do this with Ethereum, although vary slightly in mechanics/decentralization/composability.

They let you earn interest with a liquid ETH token wrapper.

You can also invest in the governance tokens of the protocols themselves.
